  <summary>Day1 (Expanding Cards)</summary>
  
  **Things I Learned**
  - how to define multiple classes into a single const 
  - adding and removing classes based on mouseclick event
  - vw(viewport width), recommended due to it's dependency on the viewport rather than it's parent
  - vh(viewport height), same as above
  - font-size(rem), same as above in terms of responsive layouts
  
  **Original Ideas**
  1. website top page
  eg. campaigns (a peek can be enough to want to scroll)
  2. illustrated story
  eg. educational game, storytelling puzzles (easy to flip back for hints and clues, although a lock for new stages or clues would also be added for limited access)
  3. simplr story-telling
  eg. japanese kamishibai (pictures/illustrations/iamges and text could be added to create an original story for kids)
  4. thoughtful gesture
  eg. card-like (to send to loved ones as thoughful gesture for anniversaries and such)

<details>
  <summary>Day9 (Sound Board)</summary>
  
  **Things I Learned**
  - html elements can be added in js
  - dotted borders can be cute!

  3. swooshes or simple sounds for systematic form send, etc

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day10 (Dad Jokes)</summary>
  
  **Things I Learned**
  - async function (still not that up to speed)
  - versatility of borders
  - 3 colors are enough for a simple design
  - opacity to take away some attention

  - inline-flex (flexes everything in a row)
  - writing html in js (within back quotation marks)

  **Original Ideas**
  1. generating code for simple identification?

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day12 (FAQ Collapse)</summary>

  - toggle function in js
  - was able to layout in css without help
  - color scheme's getting better
  - pseudo elements to use as background designs
  - z-index wasn't working as I'd hoped
  (there doesn't seem to be a solution for what I was doing, in front of the container but behind the text)
  - I though simply layering would solve the above... but no

  **Original Ideas**
  1. collapsable questions, information
  2. educational purposes, hiding the answers
  3. hiding list of navigations
  4. navigation panel or bar, with toggle function (in my case, I used to use boostrap for nav toggle but I think I can stop relying on it all the time)

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day13 (Random Choice Picker)</summary>
  
  **Things I Learned**
  - By far! What I wanted to implement in my new app idea
  - "keyup" was a new event I learned
  - setTimeout was very useful in setting timers on actions
  - creating an html element and using appendChild to put it within another element (second time doing it)
  - [Math.random() * tags.length], random gives 0 and 1, so multiplying it with the array length(eg.8) will be 1 * 8 and give a random number between 1~8!
  - intervals to highlight and unhighlight before the result has a nice aesthetic for randomness

  **Original Ideas**
  1. when you have a difficult time picking something
  2. menu decider (protein, veg, carb, cooking method, useful because you can enter whatever's at home)
  3. as a game(truth or dare picker)
  4. intervals for drumroll effect for a result

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day14 (Animated nav)</summary>
  
  **Things I Learned**
  - toggle event for the second time
  - eye-opening that so much movement could be achieved by css alone
  - color choices are getting better
  - font choices.. could do better
  - transform:rotate(deg) tomake diagonal lines
  - opacity to change visibility under specific conditions
  - linear was a new asepect today, need to search and learn more

  **Original Ideas**
  1. revealing info
  2. intervals to make things spin

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day15 (Increment Counter)</summary>
  
  **Things I Learned**
  - ASI(automatic semi-colon insertion) can make semi-colons optional but better practice is to add them yourself to avoid mishaps
  - increment means to increase(didin't know what the counter was at first)
  - aesthetically pleasing to see the movement in numbers
  - data-target(data-*) is used to store info private to the page or app to be used within other functions as well by developers(eg. short text in place of a long link, a target value to reach)
  - Math.ceil rounds off to greater than or equal to

  **Original Ideas**
  1. could be modified to alphabets
  2. reveal answers(IQ test result, personality check app to reveal type)
  3. graph numbers when first loaded or reloaded for different conditions

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day16 (Drink Water)</summary>
  
  **Things I Learned**
  - I'm not really good at math but understanding the concept enabled me to modify when necessary
  - Math and equations can be searched or generated by AI and adapted to the project
  - very simple but expressive use of color
  - changing visibility and height
  - flexbox can do almost anything!

  **Original Ideas**
  1. filling graphs
  2. data ranges
  3. form-filling progress

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day17 (Movie App)</summary>
  
  **Things I Learned**
  - I haven't been up to speed lately with styding Java alongside
  - box-shadows (header, search, etc)
  - understanding transform and translates better than before
  - rounding off in js (being able to search and implement what I had in mind was a step forward)
  - using API's in js is still a little hazy so will try and improve on that

  **Original Ideas**
  1. info on images, graphs, forms (directions on usage)
  2. API could be used for personal or public use! (I wouldn't mind my own personal movie or recipe search)

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day18 (Background Slider)</summary>
  
  **Things I Learned**
  - I've done this with a cdn before, but I see that it can be done easily without one too
  - I'm getting the hang of writing the js code after understanding what the functions for
  - image/file paths and what "./" or "../" mean(still get a little confused when errors pop up)
  - I'm getting better at color contrasts


  **Original Ideas**
  1. It's easthetically pleasing to look at! Could be used for individual product images
  2. Memories(has an emotional look to it)
  3. I would definitely used this for multiple images without the bg-image as well

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day19 (Theme Clock)</summary>
  
  **Things I Learned**
  - mixins, stil need to explore ideal usage but very useful!
  - theme change can be achieved quite easily using js and css styling
  - would like to experiment more on theme button design
  - root and scss variables don't mix well together(there did seem to be a way though, need to read further)
  - originality in design make me feel loads better than when I started
  - UI/UX theory needs to be learned but maybe with layouts in remakes
  - loginc for a 12-hour format clock
  - calculations will either be copied from generous sources or generated via AI(I suck at math, no joke)

  **Original Ideas**
  1. blog site for easthetic purposes(could be useful when uploading or setting timers as well)
  2. theme color's definitely something I would incorporate on all projects as defaults
  3. would be awesome to make different thems(pastels, mocha, vivid, dark, light, hacker, etc)
  4. the needles could probably be paired with the "05 Blurry Loading" to create a spinning needle loader?

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day20 (Button Ripple Effect)</summary>
  
  **Things I Learned**
  - I've added multiple buttons 
  - position relative and absolute can be used within the same class because they're relative to their parent
  - took me a while, but managed to position my buttons seemingly in a random scatter using absolute position with vh and vw
  - custom border radius in % can't be used on an element with height and width in % as well(I used px for sizing and @media to adjust for size)
  - getting a better sense of design and ideas
  - in js, I've written the event handler function outside of the function as opposed to what I was referencing(for readability and better practice in js)
  - determining the position of an element with simple logic in js using x, y, targets and offset

  **Original Ideas**
  1. I'd like to try using different shapes and colors to contrast or complement
  2. other events such as keyUp could be used as a rippling typing experience(a little like RGB lighting on a gaming keyboard)

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day21 (Drag N Drop)</summary>
  
  **Things I Learned**
  - setting a background image using unsplash link
  - making a clean simple look for dropping boundaries
  - setting draggable in html(first time)
  - dragging and dropping by setting classnames and background images in css accordingly

  **Original Ideas**
  1. interactive gamefied app
  2. jigsaw puzzle app

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day22 (Drawing App)</summary>
  
  **Things I Learned**
  - canvas tag is used with javascript for drawing
  - the height and width for the canvas are assigned directly in the HTML markup to define the initial resolution
  - the resolution is important for accuracy when drawing
  - making custom buttons, box-shadow and inline-flex
  - customizing border and radius to join seamlessly
  - using icons instead of text for better aesthetics
  - various mouse events
  - custom cursor design to be detected by js event
  - different methods to determine coordinates and using then to draw seamlessly
  - updating the visible part of the size along with the actual value
  - different methods used for the context
  - creating new functions for what I thought would be more functional, such as stop drawing when out of range
  - pretty proud to be customizing as I go for better functionality and design

  **Original Ideas**
  1. picture games("e-shiritori", something like pictSense?)
  2. saving the images would make it something like the app "Paint"?
  3. could be a writing memo pad and maybe collab with AI to detext and convert to text

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day23 (Kinetic Loader)</summary>
  
  **Things I Learned**
  - triangle using the border in css
  - spinning effect created by adjusting rotating various degrees

  **Original Ideas**
  1. I'm going to try this with multiple shapes(maybe circles to overlap and look like flowers)
  2. loading effect
  3. effect to create movement on the page(slower and inconspicuous could work as a background)

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day24 (Content Placeholder)</summary>
  
  **Things I Learned**
  - setTimeout can be used for other than APIs and await for async
  - HTML character entities(&nbsp; and others)
  - adding movement to linear gradient bgs could be done with just css but timeout gives loading effect
  - rounded profile images
  - rounded text bg

  **Original Ideas**
  1. bg with movement for any content, on forms, images that take longer to load?
  2. just any header or content to give it a mobile bg as a default

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day25 (Sticky Navigation)</summary>
  
  **Things I Learned**
  - copying a website layout was somthing I hadn't done in a while
  - use of containers to flex and position elements just so
  - color scheme is getting better and better
  - scroll event was a first, pretty easy to understand

  **Original Ideas**
  1. scroll and ease-in-out to time content display
  2. could do this for a footer as well(display little when reading the content, and reveal the full footer when hovering or at the page end) 

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day26 (Vertical Slider)</summary>
  
  **Things I Learned**
  - nesting div in scss is equivalent to "class > div"
  - clientHeight
  - using an arrow function to declare a function(ES6) rather than the traditional style
  - setting inline styles have merits such as, quick prototyping, fewer http requests, quick render and specifying styles for specific elements
  - background shorthand
  - using querySelectAll to define length of an array

  **Original Ideas**
  1. with setTimeout to automatically slide on a landing page
  2. presentation-like content

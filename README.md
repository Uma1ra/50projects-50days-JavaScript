# 50projects-50days-JavaScript
I'm aiming to complete 1 project per day to improve my basic front-end skills in 50 days.

Feel free to use my tweeked(font, colors, css, scss) version: https://github.com/Uma1ra/50projects-50days-JavaScript

Referenced Github Repo: https://github.com/bradtraversy/50projects50days

## Overall Goals
- deeper understanding of JavaScript code
- being able to utilize the code for original projects
- committing to the *1 project a day* goal
- improve basic skills of local developing tools such as **VS Code** and **Github Destktop**
-  daily review

### Daily Goals
- understand the goal of the project
- 2 original ideas from the project
- Write a daily review here on Readme as a reminder of what I've achieved with this endeavour

  <summary>Day1 (Expanding Cards)</summary>
  
  **Things I Learned**
  - how to define multiple classes into a single const 
  - adding and removing classes based on mouseclick event
  - vw(viewport width), recommended due to it's dependency on the viewport rather than it's parent
  - vh(viewport height), same as above
  - font-size(rem), same as above in terms of responsive layouts
  
  **Original Ideas**
  1. website top page
  eg. campaigns (a peek can be enough to want to scroll)
  2. illustrated story
  eg. educational game, storytelling puzzles (easy to flip back for hints and clues, although a lock for new stages or clues would also be added for limited access)
  3. simplr story-telling
  eg. japanese kamishibai (pictures/illustrations/iamges and text could be added to create an original story for kids)
  4. thoughtful gesture
  eg. card-like (to send to loved ones as thoughful gesture for anniversaries and such)

  - cubic-bezier(interesting way to add custom animation, found a testing site as well)
  - transition delays using index
  - how to create as easy but stylish form with overlapping labels
  - pointer-event(hadn't ocurred to me)
  
  **Original Ideas**

<details>
  <summary>Day9 (Sound Board)</summary>
  
  **Things I Learned**
  - html elements can be added in js
  - dotted borders can be cute!
  - there's an issue with calling fonts (works in * but not in body)
  - opacity can only be used 0.9 and below (tried darkening with 1.5, don't know why I thought that'd work)
  
  **Original Ideas**
  1. pressing buttons in games (actions, events)
  2. quiz answers (right or wrong ding)
  3. swooshes or simple sounds for systematic form send, etc

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day10 (Dad Jokes)</summary>
  
  **Things I Learned**
  - async function (still not that up to speed)
  - versatility of borders
  - 3 colors are enough for a simple design
  - opacity to take away some attention
  
  **Original Ideas**
  1. random recipe/quote/whatever generator
  2. baby name generator

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day11 (Event KeyCodes)</summary>
  
  **Things I Learned**
  - "keydown" event
  - inline-flex (flexes everything in a row)
  - writing html in js (within back quotation marks)

  **Original Ideas**
  1. generating code for simple identification?
  2. "keydown" event could be used for fun interactive screen

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day12 (FAQ Collapse)</summary>
  
  **Things I Learned**
  - toggle function in js
  - was able to layout in css without help
  - color scheme's getting better
  - pseudo elements to use as background designs
  - z-index wasn't working as I'd hoped
  (there doesn't seem to be a solution for what I was doing, in front of the container but behind the text)
  - I though simply layering would solve the above... but no

  **Original Ideas**
  1. collapsable questions, information
  2. educational purposes, hiding the answers
  3. hiding list of navigations
  4. navigation panel or bar, with toggle function (in my case, I used to use boostrap for nav toggle but I think I can stop relying on it all the time)

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day13 (Random Choice Picker)</summary>
  
  **Things I Learned**
  - By far! What I wanted to implement in my new app idea
  - "keyup" was a new event I learned
  - setTimeout was very useful in setting timers on actions
  - creating an html element and using appendChild to put it within another element (second time doing it)
  - [Math.random() * tags.length], random gives 0 and 1, so multiplying it with the array length(eg.8) will be 1 * 8 and give a random number between 1~8!
  - intervals to highlight and unhighlight before the result has a nice aesthetic for randomness

  **Original Ideas**
  1. when you have a difficult time picking something
  2. menu decider (protein, veg, carb, cooking method, useful because you can enter whatever's at home)
  3. as a game(truth or dare picker)
  4. intervals for drumroll effect for a result

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day14 (Animated nav)</summary>
  
  **Things I Learned**
  - toggle event for the second time
  - eye-opening that so much movement could be achieved by css alone
  - color choices are getting better
  - font choices.. could do better
  - transform:rotate(deg) tomake diagonal lines
  - opacity to change visibility under specific conditions
  - linear was a new asepect today, need to search and learn more

  **Original Ideas**
  1. revealing info
  2. intervals to make things spin

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Day15 (Increment Counter)</summary>
  
  **Things I Learned**
  - ASI(automatic semi-colon insertion) can make semi-colons optional but better practice is to add them yourself to avoid mishaps
  - increment means to increase(didin't know what the counter was at first)
  - aesthetically pleasing to see the movement in numbers
  - data-target(data-*) is used to store info private to the page or app to be used within other functions as well by developers(eg. short text in place of a long link, a target value to reach)
  - Math.ceil rounds off to greater than or equal to

  **Original Ideas**
  1. could be modified to alphabets
  2. reveal answers(IQ test result, personality check app to reveal type)

  <summary>Day1 (Expanding Cards)</summary>
  
  **Things I Learned**
  - how to define multiple classes into a single const 
  - adding and removing classes based on mouseclick event
  - vw(viewport width), recommended due to it's dependency on the viewport rather than it's parent
  - vh(viewport height), same as above
  - font-size(rem), same as above in terms of responsive layouts
  
  **Original Ideas**
  1. website top page
  eg. campaigns (a peek can be enough to want to scroll)
  2. illustrated story
  eg. educational game, storytelling puzzles (easy to flip back for hints and clues, although a lock for new stages or clues would also be added for limited access)
  3. simplr story-telling
  eg. japanese kamishibai (pictures/illustrations/iamges and text could be added to create an original story for kids)
  4. thoughtful gesture
  eg. card-like (to send to loved ones as thoughful gesture for anniversaries and such)

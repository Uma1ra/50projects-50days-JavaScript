# 50projects-50days-JavaScript
I'm aiming to complete 1 project per day to improve my basic front-end skills in 50 days

## Overall Goals
- deeper understanding of JavaScript code
- being able to utilize the code for original projects
- committing to the *1 project a day* goal
- improve basic skills of local developing tools such as **VS Code** and **Github Destktop**
-  daily review

### Daily Goals
- understand the goal of the project
- 2 original ideas from the project
- Write a daily review here on Readme as a reminder of what I've achieved with this endeavour

### Day1 (Expanding Cards)
**Understanding**
- how to define multiple classes into a single const 
- adding and removing classes based on mouseclick event
- vw(viewport width), recommended due to it's dependency on the viewport rather than it's parent
- vh(viewport height), same as above
- font-size, same as above in terms of responsive layouts
**Original Ideas**
1. website top page
eg. campaigns (a peek can be enough to want to scroll)
2. illustrated story
eg. educational game, storytelling puzzles (easy to flip back for hints and clues, although a lock for new stages or clues would also be added for limited access)
3. simplr story-telling
eg. japanese kamishibai (pictures/illustrations/iamges and text could be added to create an original story for kids)
4. thoughtful gesture
eg. card-like (to send to loved ones as thoughful gesture for anniversaries and such)
